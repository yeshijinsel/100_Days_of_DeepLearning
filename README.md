# 100_Days_of_DeepLearning
# ( PyTorch Scholarship Challenge for Deep Learning NanoDegree)<br />
I am doing this PyTorch Scholarship Challenge by Facebook in Udacity and it's a 2 month Challenge and complete the whole lesson with assignment and also Final Project.<br />
So Lets DO IT.

## Day 1: 24 November 2018
Today I complete the Basic of Neural Networks Concept like:<br />
                  Lesson 2 of Challenge <br />
                  Preceptron<br />
                  Activation Function<br />
                  FeedForward<br />
