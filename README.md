# 100_Days_of_DeepLearning
# ( PyTorch Scholarship Challenge for Deep Learning NanoDegree)<br />
I am doing this PyTorch Scholarship Challenge by Facebook in Udacity and it's a 2 month Challenge and complete the whole lesson with assignment and also Final Project.<br />
So Lets DO IT.

## Day 1: 24 November 2018
Today I complete the Basic of Neural Networks Concept like:<br />
                  Lesson 2 of Challenge <br />
                  Preceptron<br />
                  Activation Function<br />
                  FeedForward<br />
## Resources:

## Day 2: 25 November 2018
Today I just complete some basic problems of preceptron and forward propagation.<br />
   Backpropagation<br />
   Logistic Regression<br />
   gradient descent and loss(Mean Square Error, Cross Entropy)<br />

 ## Day 8: 1 December 2018
 Starting Lesson 5 : (CNN) Convolution Neural Networks
               Intro to CNN<br />
 There are lots of CNN Resources but if you wanna follow some cool stuff then try CS231 course from Standford, Very Nice and cool to learn.
